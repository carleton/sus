Signup Sheets is a block to allow users to create date-time based openings and specify other users that may sign up for those openings. This block is user-centric rather than course-centric.

This block works with moodle 1.9.x, and NOT with 2.x (that's a work in progress...)


TO DO
-----
+ developer documentation (architecture, code, styles)


To Test
-------
+ interaction with other blocks/modules/themes that use jquery

+ cron processes (daily reminder emails) NOTE: as of 2011/06/29 there
was some question about whether reminder emails are working, though
the alert emails are fine



Wish List
---------
+ ics, ical, google cal etc. integration/export

+ groups relevance
